# Grade-Managment-System
**Overview**

The Grade Management System is a console-based application built in C++ as part of my university's open-ended lab project. The program is designed to help users manage and display students' grades efficiently. This project emphasizes fundamental programming concepts, including loops, control and selection structures, functions, and multidimensional arrays, while following best practices in code indentation and organization.

**Features**

**Add Student Marks:** Allows the user to input marks for multiple students across different subjects.

**Display Grades:** Outputs the grades of all students in a formatted table.

**Calculate Averages:** Computes and displays the average grade of each student.

**Updates Grades:** Enables user to update a specific student's grades in their respective subjects.

Key Programming Concepts Demonstrated

**1. Loops**

Used for iterating over student records and subjects to input and display grades.

Example: for loops and while loops ensure efficient traversal of multidimensional arrays containing grades.

**2. Control and Selection Structures**

Includes if, else if, else and switch statements for decision-making.

Example: Validating user input for menu options and handling invalid entries gracefully.

**3. Functions Without Return Values (void Functions)**

Used for modularity and code organization.

Examples:

void input() for inputting student marks.

void grades() for displaying all student grades in a formatted manner.

void avg1() & void avg2() for computing and displaying student and subject average grades.

**4. Multidimensional Arrays**

Used to store grades for multiple students across several subjects.

Example: A 2D array where rows represent students and columns represent their grades in different subjects.

**5. Proper Indentation and Code Readability**

The code follows consistent indentation and spacing for better readability and maintenance.

Example: Each block of code inside loops or conditional statements is properly indented.

**Conclusion**

This project highlights my understanding of foundational C++ programming concepts and demonstrates my ability to write clean, modular, and efficient code. The Grade Management System is a stepping stone toward developing more complex applications in the future.
